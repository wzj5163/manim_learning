Learn to start using manic

1. How to install and quick start in [3b1b tutorial](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/getting_started/configuration.html).
2. Some examples of [Jupyter Notebook](https://hub-binder.mybinder.ovh/user/manimcommunity-jupyter_examples-5j9oqr4w/notebooks/First%20Steps%20with%20Manim.ipynb)
3. Video of using [Google Colab for manim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4sEdnXPpA).
4. Tutorials for installation and guides in [Manim Community](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/macos.html).
5. Youtube video for [manim turotial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUsUrbWb2D4).
6. Elteoremadebeethoven github website for [manim tutorials](https://github.com/Elteoremadebeethoven), while some contents are not free.
7. 3b1b official [github](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), you can download repository and read the steps to install manimgl. I think for installation, [this](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/getting_started/configuration.html) 3b1b tutorial is more clear.
8. Youtube video of manim tutorials for installation, by a [brilliant child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZX5_cr_ksw) who speaks very clearly. From very beginning, install via brew and use atom. However, I cannot use atom because I cannot install Uber-Juno package.
9. [Chinese](https://github.com/cai-hust/manim-tutorial-CN) github tutorial for manim, not very clear.  No examples. Summary of manim grammer is nice. Have to combine other tutorials.


Run codes:
- `manim % manimgl start.py SquareToCircle -o`
